# J20 Foamboard RC Plane

A foamboard RC plane designed with a stealth fighter-style shape inspired by the J20 jet. Simple construction focused on lightweight, stability, and aerodynamic performance.

## Design Overview

- Sleek, delta wing shape with twin vertical stabilizers  
- Foamboard main structure with slots for easy assembly  
- Open cavity in the center for electronics and battery placement  
- Straight edges and clean lines for efficient cutting and building  

## Materials

- Foamboard sheets for airframe and fins  
- Lightweight adhesive (hot glue or foam-safe glue)  
- Control surfaces to be added based on servo setup (not shown)  

## Assembly Notes

- Slot together main wing and vertical fins for structural rigidity  
- Ensure tight fit of parts to avoid wobble in flight  
- Reinforce key joints with glue or tape to handle flight stresses  
- Keep weight minimal by trimming excess foamboard carefully  

## Flight Considerations

- Balance CG near the center slot for stable flight  
- Use light, responsive servos for control surfaces  
- Start with gentle throttle and smooth control inputs  
- Test on calm days for best handling results
